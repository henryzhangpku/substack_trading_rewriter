To deploy and install your Chrome extension manually, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Extension Files**
Make sure you have the following files in a folder (e.g., `substack_trading_rewriter`):
- `manifest.json` (already provided)
- `background.js` (if needed)
- `popup.html` (if needed)
- `content.js` (if you need to modify the Substack editor)
- Any additional JavaScript or assets

### **Step 2: Load the Extension in Chrome**
1. **Open Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Enable Developer Mode** (toggle at the top-right corner).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the folder containing your extension files (`substack_trading_rewriter`).
5. The extension should now be installed and visible in your extensions list.

### **Step 3: Test the Extension**
- Go to **Substack Editor** (`https://substack.com/`)
- If the extension modifies the page or adds a button, check if it appears.
- Open the **Chrome DevTools (`F12` > Console/Network)** to debug any issues.

### **Step 4: Pack and Publish (Optional)**
If you want to distribute the extension via the Chrome Web Store:
1. **Zip** the folder containing your extension files.
2. Go to the [Chrome Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/).
3. **Upload the ZIP**, fill in details, and submit for review.
